# Paying suppliers

Users who operate a shop with multiple suppliers \(hub users\) often ask us for the quickest way to forward payments that they receive from customers, to their suppliers. For example, you may stock products from 20 producers in your hub shop. After you receive customer orders and payments, you want a quick way to work out how much you need to transfer to each supplier and then quickly make payment.

This page describes a couple of ways that users can pay their suppliers.

## **Working out how much you owe your suppliers**

You can use [Reports ](../../basic-features/reports.md)to get a breakdown of the value of goods sold from each supplier. The [Order Cycle Supplier Totals](../../basic-features/reports.md#order-cycle-supplier-totals) report gives the total value of goods sold from each supplier. Alternatively you can download the Order Cycle Customer Totals report and create some pivot tables to extract the data you need.

## **Paying suppliers**

Once you have the dollar values that you need to pay to each supplier, the next step is often to enter these amounts into your online banking system, to do a bank transfer to each supplier. This can be time consuming for those with numerous suppliers.

At the moment Abukem doesn't have an automated system for calculating what is owed to suppliers and automatically forwarding payments to them.
