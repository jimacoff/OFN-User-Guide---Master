# Thermally printed receipts

## Print receipts with a Thermal Printer

{% hint style="info" %}
This functionality is currently only available to Abukem users.

## Printer

What printer do I need to print a “receipt”, like the one you usually get in a store? You need a thermal printer that talks ESC/P control language \(most of them do\).

For instance:

lansaget 100 \(most common in shops\). Available on Amazon for approx USD $135  
Low cost no-name one \(USD $33\): Available on Amazon for approx USD $33

## Setup

How do I setup my machine to be able to print receipts from the Abukem?

First you need to install the printer:

Linux instructions  
Windows instructions  
OSX instructions  
For USB printer you might not have to precise the URI, just make sure you use the relevant driver.

Then you need to install QZ Tray which is a plug-in for printers that will launch the printing of the receipt without you having to select the printer and click on “print”.

Download and execute the installer for your OS here.

Launch QZ Tray if it didn’t launch automatically.

Then open the page “print\_ticket.html” in your browser, digital certificates will crash but you will be able to print a test page \(like this one\)

## Printing receipts in OFN

Then how to print a receipt in the OFN in your daily use?

Click orders in the blue menu, click on a customer order. Under the actions menu you will see print receipt. Click on it. A new tab should open, after allowing the communication with QZ Tray it will show a list of your printers, select the thermal one and it will print the receipt.

The selected printer will be saved in your browser, if you wish to change it there is a button for this under the same “actions” menu as for printing the receipt.
